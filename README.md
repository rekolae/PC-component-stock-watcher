# PC-component-stock-watcher

Thanks to the combined terror of COVID, scalpers and overall global shortage, especially GPUs are really hard to come by. This program aims to help you find out when there actually is stock only to get to the page and start to cry when the scalper bots have already hogged all of the stock.

Idea for this project was created out of my own frustration as well as interest in trying new things and combining them together.

The project consist of several independant components:
* Database for storing product information (might be overkill but wanted to learn using SQLite with python)
* Requesting store pages and crawling through them to get product data
* CLI/GUI that shows current product status
* Email daemon that can send email's about products with stock


# Commit messages and format

Commit messages should be clearly written in english and be compact to ensure easy reading e.g.
* `"[258-ESC-BSOD-FIX] Fixed BSOD when pressing ESC exactly 666 times"`

When it comes to commits the more the merrier compared to one huge commit with a message that spans 5 rows.

To automate adding the `[<Issue ID>-<branch description>]` to the beginning of a commit messages have a look at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/rekolae/28b2b0d27cff688b77f1642989e1cc24).

It can be installed by renaming `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg.sample` to `prepare-commit-msg` and pasting the script in the gist to the file and making it executable (if needed). 

This way `$ git commit -m "[<Issue ID>-<branch description>] Fixed this and..."` can be written without the issue id and branch part as: `$ git commit -m "Fixed this and..."` saving many many key presses and your nerves.

Couple of example branch names:
* `feature/123-GUI-refactoring` 
* `bugfix/666-fix-BSOD-on-click`


## Main Branches

The main repository will always hold two evergreen branches:

* `master`
* `stable`

The main branch should be considered `origin/master` and will be the main branch where the source code of `HEAD` always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.

Consider `origin/stable` to always represent the latest code which could be deployed to production.

When the source code in the `master` branch is considered stable, all of the changes will be merged into `stable`. If `stable` has gained enough significant changes, the changes are tagged with a release number.


## Supporting Branches

Supporting branches are used to aid parallel development, ease tracking of features, and to assist in quickly fixing production problems. Unlike the main branches, these branches always have a limited life time, since they will be removed eventually.

The different types of branches used are:

* Feature branches
* Bug branches
* Hotfix branches

Each of these branches have a specific purpose and are bound to strict rules as to which branches may be their originating branch and which branches must be their merge targets.


## Tagging releases and hotfixes

When a stable branch has gotten to the point that a release should be made, it has to be tagged with a corresponding version number. The version number should follow semantic versioning format i.e. `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where incrementing conforms to the following:

* `MAJOR` number increment when you make incompatible API changes
* `MINOR` number increment when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
* `PATCH` number increment when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

See [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for more infomation.

In practise tagging works as follows:

```
$ git checkout stable                               // Change to the stable branch
$ git merge --no-ff master                          // Forces creation of commit object during merge
$ git tag                                           // List tags to check latest version number
V1.0.0
V1.0.1
$ git tag -a <V1.1.0> -m <msg, e.g "Release...">    // Tags the fix
$ git push origin stable --tags                     // Push tag changes
```

or when a hotfix was issued:

```
$ git commit -m "Hotfix for..."                     // Commit changes
$ git checkout stable                               // Change to the stable branch
$ git merge --no-ff <hotfix-branch-name>            // Forces creation of commit object during merge
$ git tag                                           // List tags to check latest version number
V1.0.0
V1.0.1
V1.1.0
$ git tag -a <V1.1.1> -m <msg, e.g "Hotfix...">     // Tags the fix
$ git push origin stable --tags                     // Push tag changes
```


## Working with a feature branch

If the branch does not exist yet, create the branch locally and then push to GitHub. A feature branch should always be 'publicly' available. That is, development should never exist in just one developer's local branch.

```
$ git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>             // Creates a local branch for the new feature
$ git push origin <feature-branch-name>             // Makes the new feature remotely available
```

Periodically, changes made to `master` (if any) should be merged back into the current feature branch.

```
$ git merge master                                  // Merges changes from master into feature branch
```

When development on the feature is complete, the lead (or engineer in charge) should merge changes into `master` and then make sure the remote branch is deleted.

```
$ git checkout master                               // Change to the master branch  
$ git merge --no-ff <feature-branch-name>           // Makes sure to create a commit object during merge
$ git push origin master                            // Push merge changes
$ git push origin :<feature-branch-name>            // Deletes the remote branch, git push origin --delete <feature-branch-name> works as well
```


## Working with a hotfix branch

If the branch does not exist yet, create the branch locally and then push to GitHub. A hotfix branch should always be 'publicly' available. That is, development should never exist in just one developer's local branch.

```
$ git checkout -b <hotfix-branch-name> stable       // Creates a local branch for the new hotfix
$ git push origin <hotfix-branch-name>              // Makes the new hotfix remotely available
```

When development on the hotfix is complete, merge changes into `stable` and then update the tag.

```
$ git checkout stable                               // Change to the stable branch
$ git merge --no-ff <hotfix-branch-name>            // Forces creation of commit object during merge
$ git tag -a <tag> -m <msg>                         // Tags the fix
$ git push origin stable --tags                     // Push tag changes
```

Merge changes into `master` so not to lose the hotfix and then delete the remote hotfix branch.

```
$ git checkout master                               // Change to the master branch
$ git merge --no-ff <hotfix-branch-name>            // Forces creation of commit object during merge
$ git push origin master                            // Push merge changes
$ git push origin :<hotfix-branch-name>             // Deletes the remote branch, git push origin --delete <hotfix-branch-name> works as well
```
